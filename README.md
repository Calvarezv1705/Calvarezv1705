### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 &nbsp;Programming is more than a job, it's a form of art that transforms ideas into reality and unleashes my creativity.\
🎓 &nbsp;I'm currently studying software engineer at the University of EAFIT.\
🌱 &nbsp;I'm on my way to learn more about Artificial Intelligence, and more languages that let me unleash my creativity.\
✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, besides learning new things, I like to do exercise and other activities that keep me active and healthy.\
💬 &nbsp;I'm open to opportunities for work, internships or project collaboration. If you want to collaborate or discuss ideas, feel free to contact me, I'm here to connect and create!.\
